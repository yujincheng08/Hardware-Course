WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (DPIR-1) Asynchronous driver check - DSP vga/RAddr input pin vga/RAddr/C[3] is connected to registers with an asynchronous reset. This is preventing the possibility of merging these registers in to the DSP Block since the DSP block registers only possess synchronous reset capability.  It is suggested to recode or change these registers to remove the reset or use a synchronous reset to get the best optimization for performance, power and area.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (DPOP-1) PREG Output pipelining - DSP vga/RAddr output vga/RAddr/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (DPOP-2) MREG Output pipelining - DSP vga/RAddr multiplier stage vga/RAddr/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (DPREG-4) DSP48E1_PregDynOpmodeZmuxP: - The DSP48E1 cell vga/RAddr with the given dynamic OPMODE[6:0] connections may lead to an unregistered asynchronous feedback path without the PREG attribute enabled. Please refer to the user guide and if one of the internal P feedback opmodes is possible for this design the PREG attribute must be set to 1, currently set to 0
