WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (CFGBVS-1) Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties - Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PDRC-153) Gated clock check - Net clock/d_hour0_out is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin clock/d_hour_reg_i_1/O, cell clock/d_hour_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PDRC-153) Gated clock check - Net clock/d_min1_out is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin clock/d_min_reg_i_1/O, cell clock/d_min_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PDRC-153) Gated clock check - Net clock/d_sec2_out is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin clock/d_sec_reg_i_2/O, cell clock/d_sec_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PDRC-153) Gated clock check - Net clock/m13_min/clk_2 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin clock/m13_min/hour[7]_i_2/O, cell clock/m13_min/hour[7]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PDRC-153) Gated clock check - Net clock/m13_sec/clk_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin clock/m13_sec/count[7]_i_2/O, cell clock/m13_sec/count[7]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PLHOLDVIO-2) Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations - A LUT clock/m13_min/hour[7]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 8 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    clock/m13_hour/hour_reg[0] {FDRE}
    clock/m13_hour/hour_reg[1] {FDRE}
    clock/m13_hour/hour_reg[2] {FDRE}
    clock/m13_hour/hour_reg[3] {FDRE}
    clock/m13_hour/hour_reg[4] {FDRE}

WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PLHOLDVIO-2) Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations - A LUT clock/m13_sec/count[7]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 9 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    clock/m13_min/carry_reg {FDRE}
